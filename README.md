Oreans Code Deobfuscator

Author: [f-ve](https://github.com/f-ve)

About
===
After studying orean's (themida, code virtualizer) packing patterns and reverse engineering unvirtualizers I have decided to make my own code deobfuscator to patch obfuscated instructions. I gathered enough information from obfuscated instructions to deobfuscate code. This tool does not guarantee full unpacking capabilities. Undocumented obfuscated instructions will be logged but not handled.

Goal
===
Fight Oreans
