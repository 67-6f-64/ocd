Oreans Code Deobfuscator

Author: [f-ve](https://github.com/f-ve)

About
===
After studying Oreans' Themida, Code Virtualizer VM. I have decided to make my own deobfuscator to fix obfuscated instructions. I gathered enough information from obfuscated instructions to deobfuscate code after taking notes from personal unpacks and reverse engineering a couple unvirtualizers. Please note that this tool does not guarantee full unpacking capabilities. Undocumented obfuscated instructions will be logged but not handled.

Goal
===
Fight Oreans.
